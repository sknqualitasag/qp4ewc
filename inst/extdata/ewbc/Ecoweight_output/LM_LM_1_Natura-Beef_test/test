3.5.19. Cows on reproductive cycles 4 to LL
-------------------------------------------
In reproductive cycles 4 to LL, similar results are obtained as in cycle 3
(small differences may occur if the proportion of pregnant and not pregnant
cows differ between reproductive cycles 3 and 4 to LL).

3.6. Costs per animal in each category
--------------------------------------
  Comment:
  Cost components are given per animal for the time from birth till the 
  end of each progeny category or for the time from calving till the end
  of each cow category (see Manual for definition of categories).
  Furthermore, it is assumed that all cost components for calves till weaning 
  (except costs for supplementary feeding) are included in the costs for cows.
  Housing costs are costs for bedding minus revenues for manure. Other costs
  include costs for removing and rendering dead animals and breeding costs.
  Cost components per cow per year are averaged over all cow categories 
  (without costs for progeny).
  No cost components are printed for categories were all components are zero.
