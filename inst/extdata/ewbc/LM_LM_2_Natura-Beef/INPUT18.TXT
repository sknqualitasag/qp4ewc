/* Input parameters for program EWBC (Production Systems 1 to 3). 
   The file is necessary only for the option 2 for fattening.
   For changing input data, change the number(s) in the matrices.
   Be careful when changing input parameters. Please notice that 
     the description of the given matrix is posted under the matrix.
   The rows represent the commercial classes for fleshiness, the columns the 
     classes for fat covering. The numbers of rows and columns of all matrices
     must be in accordance with the appropriate parameters in INPUT08.TXT. 
   The matrix of coefficients of carcass prices shows the ratio of the price per
   kg carcass in the given class to the price in the base class. (See
   explanations for INPUT16.TXT in the Manual).*/
