/* This file is necessary for program EWBC (Production Systems 1 to 3), 
   the last parameter only for production system 1. It includes input
   parameters describing the reproductive cycle in pasture systems through
   time. All dates are given in the format 'year [SPACE] month [SPACE]
   day'. The number of the year must be relative, the earliest dates must
   always be in year 0, the next year is year 1 etc. The number of feeding 
   seasons (i.e feed rations which depend on seasons) during a year 
   can be 1 (that means for example that animals are pastured whole the year) 
   or 2 (different feed rations are defined for summer and winter or wet 
   and dry) season, which are coded as 1 and 2). Though only two seasonal
   feeding rations are allowed, the number of changes of feeding seasons may 
   be considerably higher than the number of feeding seasons because the
   same feeding season may repeat during the year.

   The input data are arranged in the following way:
     each parameter takes three rows, 
     
     in the first row stands its value which is given in the format 
     'month [SPACE] day' for dates (the program will convert date 
     values into the number of days since January 1st of year 0), 
     
     the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
     
     the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
     
   For changing input data, change the number(s) in the first row.
   The description of the parameter will be printed in all outputs as
     written in this file. You can make use of this and translate
     the description to your language.*/
