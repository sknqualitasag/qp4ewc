/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for Production Systems 1 to 3. 
   It includes input parameters valid for both variants of fattening. 
   Furthermore, this file covers parameters for fattening bulls that are 
   expected to be always intensively fattened independently of the variant of
   fattening for heifers or castrates.
   Losses of animals are given as the number of animals died during the fattening 
   period expressed as proportion of the number of animals that entered fattening. 
   Dressing proportion is expressed as ratio of the carcass weight and live weight 
   of animals at slaughter.
   If all surplus weaned calves are sold, the parameters connected exclusively 
   with fattening are ignored in the calculations. But some of the parameters 
   (as dressing proportion, price for slaughter animals, number of classes for 
   fleshiness and fat covering) will be needed in each calculation, as there will 
   be always culled heifers and bulls in the herd. 
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
