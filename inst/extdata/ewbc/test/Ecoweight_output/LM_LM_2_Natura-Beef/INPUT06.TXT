/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for Production Systems 1 to 3.
   It includes input parameters mainly connected with the 
   progeny testing system for beef bulls.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks. */
