/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for Production System 3 only. 
   It includes input parameters referring to the costs from purchase to calving 
   for replacement females that are purchased at certain age, weight and day
   of pregnancy (day of pregnancy may be zero).
   If there is only one feeding season defined for the whole year in 
   INPUT01.TXT, insert only values for feeding season with code 1. 
   The values for feeding season with code 2 will not be read.   
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
