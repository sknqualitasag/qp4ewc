  Cost components are given per animal for the time from birth till the

  Furthermore, it is assumed that all cost components for calves till weaning 
  (except costs for supplementary feeding) are included in the costs for cows.
  Housing costs are costs for bedding minus revenues for manure. Other costs
  include costs for removing and rendering dead animals and breeding costs.
  Cost components per cow per year are averaged over all cow categories 
  (without costs for progeny)."
