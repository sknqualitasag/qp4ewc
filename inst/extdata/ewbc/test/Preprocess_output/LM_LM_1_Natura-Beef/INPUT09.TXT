/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for extensive fattening (variant 2 
   of fattening) of heifers and castrates in Production Systems 1 to 3. 
   If no castrates are fattened the input parameters referring to castrates
   will be ignored by the program.
   Two time periods are differentiated in fattening. The  first period is the
   extensive part of fattening (mostly on pasture or roughage feed) and the
   second period is an intensive feeding period  which is applied in the case
   that animals would not reach the target slaughter weight till slaughter 
   age of 2 years when only extensive fattening is used. 
   Losses of animals are defined as animals died during the fattening period as 
   proportion of all animals entering fattening. If there is only one feeding
   season defined for the whole year in INPUT01.TXT, insert values for feeding
   season with code 1 (extensive part of fattening) and for feed ration 4
   (intensive part of fattening). The values for feeding season with code 2 
   are not read.   
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
     each parameter takes three rows,
     in the first row stands its value, 
     the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
     the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
     If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
     marks.
