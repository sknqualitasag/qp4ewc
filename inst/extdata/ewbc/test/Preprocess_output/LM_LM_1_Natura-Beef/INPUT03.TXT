/* This file is necessary for program EWBC (Production Systems 1 to 3).
   It includes input parameters describing cows and heifers in pasture systems.
   Some of the inputs referring to calving score may be of no concern. For
	example,  if the number of classes for calving performance is 4, all
	values for  calving scores 5 and 6 are ignored.   If there is only one
	feeding season defined for the whole year in INPUT01.TXT, insert values
	for feeding season with code 1 only,  the values for feeding season with
	code 2 will not be read.
	Do not omit rows with unnecessary  information in the input file. The
	program will skip the inputs which  are not needed.
   The input parameters are arranged in the following way:
        parameters for reproduction, growth, mortality, feeding, prices and
	costs.
	Speaking about the 1st, 2nd and 3rd oestrus of heifers or cows, the
	range of oestruses from the beginning of the mating period is thought.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value,
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
