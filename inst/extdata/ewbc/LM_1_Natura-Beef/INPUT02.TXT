/* This file is necessary for program EWBC (Production Systems 1 to 3).
   It includes input parameters describing reproductive cycles of the cow herd
   in pasture systems. For each reproductive cycle, cows entering this cycle are
   differentiated  in pregnant cows and cows not being pregnant. Losses of cows,
   culling etc. can be different in  both groups. Two groups of cows are
   differentiated according to calving  performance: cows with easy calving and
   cows with dystocia. Input parameters for losses of cows and calves, for
   insemination etc. can differ in both groups. Two groups of calf losses at
   calving are differentiated here: stillborn calves (12th and 13rd inputs) and
   calves died till 48 hours after birth (14th and 15th inputs). If only one
   summary statistics exists for calf losses at birth which include all calves
   died till a certain time after birth, insert these data in the vectors for
   stillborn calves and fill in only zeros in the vectors for calves died to 48
   hours after birth.
   Some of the probabilities of calving score at the end of the input file may 
   be of no concern. For example, if the number of classes for calving performance 
   is 4, all values for calving scores 5 and 6 are ignored. Do not delete rows 
   with unnecessary information in the input file. The program will skip the 
   inputs which are not needed. 

   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	the first row obtains the value of the parameter or a whole vector of  values
	for reproduction cycles 1 to LL or 1 to LL-1, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks. */

"For defining dystocia give the lowest number of the class of calving
performance which is considered to be dystocia. For example, if there are
classes 1 to 5 and classes 3 to 5 will be considered as dystocia your input will
be 3."
