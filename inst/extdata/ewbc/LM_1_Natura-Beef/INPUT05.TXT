/* This file is necessary for program EWBC only if Production System 1 
   is calculated.
   It includes input parameters referring to performance tested breeding
   bulls. The feed rations as well as other costs refer to three time periods.
   The first period is before the test when the weaned calves are getting
   used to the intensive feed ration. The second period is the test with a fixed
   length, and the third period, in which the exterior and sperm quality is
   proved, is from the test end to the time when selecting and selling bulls. 

   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
