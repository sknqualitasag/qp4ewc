/* This file is necessary for program EWBC (Production Systems 1 to 3)
   if natural mating is performed.
   It includes input parameters referring to breeding bulls kept in the cow
   herd for natural mating.
   If there is only one feeding season defined for the whole year in INPUT01.TXT
   fill in only values for feeding season with code 1; the values for code 2
   will not be read.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
