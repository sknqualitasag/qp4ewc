"Option for the calculation of the milk price
  (1 The milk price does not depend neither on the somatic
     cell count nor on other factors (protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time, curd firmness).
   2 The milk price depends only on somatic cell count.
   3 The milk price does not depend on SCC, but depends on one
     to four of the following factors: protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time and curd firmness.
   4 The milk price depends on both somatic cell count
     (SCC) and on one to four of the following factors:
     protein content, fat content, rennet coagulation time
     and curd firmness. The base prices for quality classes
     according to SCC are set first and then these prices
     are corrected for the further factors.
   5 The milk price depends on both somatic cell count
     (SCC) and on one to four of the following factors:
     protein content, fat content, rennet coagulation time
     and curd firmness. The base price for milk (milk carrier
     or milk with given fat and/or protein content and/or milk
     coagulation properties) is determined first.
     Then this price is corrected for the real values of at
     least one of the following four factors: protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time and curd firmness.
     At the last step, a further correction of the price for
     milk quality classes based on SCC is carried out.)"
