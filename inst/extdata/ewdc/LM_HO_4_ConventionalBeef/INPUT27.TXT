/* Input parameters for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   This file contains input parameters for gene flow.
   The parameter 'Number of age classes for cross-bred dams' depends on 
   the number of reproductive cycles in program EWBC. Modify this parameter 
   in the appropriate way if necessary. 
   For changing input data, change the number(s).
   Be careful when changing input parameters. Please notice that 
     the description of the given parameter or vector is posted under 
     the number(s). */
