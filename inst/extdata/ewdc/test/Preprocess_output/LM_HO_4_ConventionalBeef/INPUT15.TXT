/* This file is necessary for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   It includes input parameters connected with progeny. Two types of
   calving (after pure-bred and cross-bred mating) are distinguished giving
   two types of progeny (pure-bred and cross-bred). The first number refers to
   pure-bred (dairy) progeny and must be always given. The second number is
   for cross-bred progeny and can be omitted if there is no crossbreeding in the
   system. If a second number is given in a system without crossbreeding, this
   number is ignored and its value is of no importance (that means you can insert
   any value for it).
   The inputs for castrates are read only if there are castrates in the system.
   Similarly, the inputs for bulls in fattening are only read if there is fattening
   of bulls. The proportion of male calves for fattening is calculated from the
   first two inputs of this file.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
     Each parameter takes three rows,
     in the first row there are mostly two values:
       the first one is for pure-bred (dairy) progeny,
       the second one is for cross-bred progeny.
       If there is only one type of progeny, the parameter not concerned
       is ignored and its value is of no importance; it is recommended to
       write zeros for clarity in these cases.
     the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
     the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
     If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
     marks. */
