/* This file is necessary for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   It includes input parameters for nutrition and other costs for reared 
   and fattened progeny and for cows. Two groups of progeny are differentiated
   - pure-bred dairy progeny and cross-bred progeny. Up to two numbers are given
   for each input. The first number refers to pure-bred (dairy) progeny and
   must be always given. The second number is for cross-bred progeny and can be
   omitted if there is no crossbreeding in the system. If the second number is
   given in a system without crossbreeding, this number is ignored and its value
   is of no importance (that means you can insert any value for it).
   Inputs for castrates are ignored (skipped) if there are no castrates in the
   system. Similarly, inputs for heifers and bulls in fattening are ignored if 
   there is no fattening of these categories.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
     each parameter takes three rows,
     in the first row stands its value (two values for progeny, the first
     being for dairy progeny, the second for cross-bred progeny), 
     the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
     the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
     If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
     marks.
