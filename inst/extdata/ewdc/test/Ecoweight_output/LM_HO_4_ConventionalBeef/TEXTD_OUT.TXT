3.5 Nutrition costs"

"Comment:
The following parameters are expressed per animal and time period:
- requirements of net energy (in MJ NE)
- requirements of digestible protein (in g PDI)
- requirements of water (in liters)
- amount of fresh matter of feed ration without feed losses through wasting (in kg)
- costs for feeding (in monetary units)
The time periods are: 
- for calves (categories 3,8,9 and 10):
  * from birth to the end of the rearing period, to selling or to death
- for animals of categories 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 to 24:  
  * from the end of rearing period of calves to slaughter 
  * from the end of rearing period of calves to culling for health problems 
  * from the end of rearing period of calves to death or to selling 
- for cows (categories 25 to CC):
  * from calving to death 
  * from calving to culling
  * from calving to the end of the given reproductive cycle"

3.6 Costs per animal in each category

"  Comment:
  Cost components are expressed in MU per animal and calculated
  for the following time periods:
  - for calves (categories 1,2,3,8,9,10 and CC+1,CC+2,CC+3,CC+8,CC+9,CC+10):
    * from birth to the end of rearing period or to selling
  - for animals of categories 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 to 24 and CC+4, CC+5, CC+6,
    CC+7, CC+10 to CC+24:  
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to slaughter 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to culling for health problems 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to death or to selling 
  - for replacement heifers (category 22) 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to entering the herd 
  - for cows (categories 25 to CC), including Total cost:
    * from calving to death 
    * from calving to culling
    * from calving to the end of the given reproductive cycle
   Total cost for all animal categories except for cows are the sum of all
   cost from the birth of the animal to the end of its life (to slaughter,
   to culling or to death of the animal) or to the time when changing the 
   category (i.e. the time when the replacement heifers enter the herd)"
