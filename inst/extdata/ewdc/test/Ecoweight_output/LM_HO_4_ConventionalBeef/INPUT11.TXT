/* This file is necessary for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   It includes input parameters describing the dairy cow herd.
   The input parameters are arranged in the following way:
        parameters for reproduction, growth, mortality, feeding, prices and costs.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value,
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
   MU: monetary unit */

"For defining dystocia give the lowest number of the class of calving
performance which is considered to be dystocia. For example, if there are
classes 1 to 5 and classes 3 to 5 will be considered as dystocia your input will
be 3."
