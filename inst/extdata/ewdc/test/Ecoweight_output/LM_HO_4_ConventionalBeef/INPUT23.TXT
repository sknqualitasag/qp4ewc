/* This file is necessary for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   It includes economic, management and biological input parameters. 
   Equal values of some of the parameters are expected for both progeny groups 
   (dairy and cross-bred progeny). If a difference occurs, insert the weighted
   average of the two values (weighted by the number of progeny in both groups). 
   Some data for slaughter weight refer to the beef breed which is used for 
   crossing. 
   Inputs referring to castrates are skipped when reading data if there are no 
   castrates in the system. Similarly, inputs for fattened bulls or heifers 
   are skipped, if there is no fattening of bulls or heifers, respectively, 
   in the system.
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
     each parameter takes three rows,
     in the first row stands its value, 
     the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
     the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
     If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
     marks.
