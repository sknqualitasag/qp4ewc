      *** Important! ***
      When choosing this option you must first run program EWBC with
      Production System 3 to generate the files FROM1_3.TXT and T.TXT.
    4 Combination of fattening and export of cross-bred female calves):  1
Pure-bred castrates in fattening
   (0 No pure-bred castrates
    1 There are pure-bred castrates which are fattened
    Warning: This value may be changed by the program when it is in
    contradiction with input parameters in INPUT15.TXT.):  0
Cross-bred castrates in fattening
   (0 No cross-bred castrates
    1 There are cross-bred castrates which are fattened
    Warning: This value may be changed by the program when it is in
    contradiction with input parameters in INPUT15.TXT.):  0
Way of calculating feed cost
  (1 on the base of energy and protein content in feed rations
   2 only on the base of energy content in feed):  1
Option for calculating economic weights
  (0 Economic weights are calculated only for traits expressed in pure-bred dairy
     progeny (when no terminal crossing is used)
   1 Economic weights are calculated only for traits expressed in cross-bred progeny
     (when only economic weights for beef cattle are of interest)
   2 Economic weight are calculated for traits both expressed in pure-bred and
     cross-bred progeny (when economic weights for dairy cattle are of interest
     and terminal crossing in dairy herds is used):  1
Selection group for which gene flow is calculated
  (1 Dairy sires
   2 Dairy dams
   3 Beef sires):  3
Data for mastitis incidence

   1 are available):  0
Quota for milk market
  (1 Free market for milk and milk component (fat and protein)
   2 Quota system for milk yield only
   3 Quota system for milk yield and fat content):  1
Option for the calculation of the milk price
  (1 The milk price does not depend neither on the somatic
     cell count nor on other factors (protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time, curd firmness).
   2 The milk price depends only on somatic cell count.
   3 The milk price does not depend on SCC, but depends on one
     to four of the following factors: protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time and curd firmness.
   4 The milk price depends on both somatic cell count
     (SCC) and on one to four of the following factors:
     protein content, fat content, rennet coagulation time
     and curd firmness. The base prices for quality classes
     according to SCC are set first and then these prices
     are corrected for the further factors.
   5 The milk price depends on both somatic cell count
     (SCC) and on one to four of the following factors:
     protein content, fat content, rennet coagulation time
     and curd firmness. The base price for milk (milk carrier
     or milk with given fat and/or protein content and/or milk
     coagulation properties) is determined first.
     Then this price is corrected for the real values of at
     least one of the following four factors: protein content,
     fat content, rennet coagulation time and curd firmness.
     At the last step, a further correction of the price for
     milk quality classes based on SCC is carried out.):  1
Data for curd firmness

   1 are of interest and are available ):  0
Data for rennet coagulation time
  (0 are not available or not of interest

Number of reproductive cycles (should be in the range from 4

3.6 Costs per animal in each category
--------------------------------------
  Comment:
  Cost components are expressed in MU per animal and calculated
  for the following time periods:
  - for calves (categories 1,2,3,8,9,10 and CC+1,CC+2,CC+3,CC+8,CC+9,CC+10):
    * from birth to the end of rearing period or to selling
  - for animals of categories 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 to 24 and CC+4, CC+5, CC+6,
    CC+7, CC+10 to CC+24:  
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to slaughter 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to culling for health problems 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to death or to selling 
  - for replacement heifers (category 22) 
    * from the end of rearing period of calves to entering the herd 
  - for cows (categories 25 to CC), including Total cost:
    * from calving to death 
    * from calving to culling
    * from calving to the end of the given reproductive cycle
   Total cost for all animal categories except for cows are the sum of all
   cost from the birth of the animal to the end of its life (to slaughter,
   to culling or to death of the animal) or to the time when changing the 
   category (i.e. the time when the replacement heifers enter the herd)
  Costs components not printed here are zero.
