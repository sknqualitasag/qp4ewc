/* This file is necessary for program EWDC. It contains input parameters 
   for calculating relative economic weights. 
   In this file you are asked to choose between two alternative definitions of
   the same trait. Always two trait definitions are presented with a number in
   parantheses. Type the number of the definition you prefer. 
   The appropriate input is skipped if the trait is not considered in the
   calculation.  
   All input data are arranged in the following way 
        each parameter takes three parts,
        the parameter value is given in the first row, 
        the string expression in the second part describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third part contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, [SPACE] is written enclosed into quotation
	marks. */
