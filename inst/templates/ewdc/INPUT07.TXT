/* This file is necessary for program EWDC (Production System 4).
   It includes input parameters describing reproductive cycles (lactations)
   of the dairy cow herd. In each reproductive cycle, cows can be mated to 
   dairy bulls or to beef bulls. Losses of cows, culling, conception rate
   and abortion are assumed to be the same in both groups of cows, 
   but differences are possible for dystocia occurrence. Therefore four groups
   of cows are differentiated according to calving performance: 
   cows with easy calving and cows with dystocia in both mating types. 
   The input parameters for losses of cows and calves, for conception rate etc.
   can differ between the groups with and without dystocia occurrence.
   
   Two groups of calf losses at calving are differentiated here: stillborn
   calves (12th and 13rd vectors) and calves died till 48 hours after birth 
   (14th and 15th vectors). If only one summary statistics exists for calf
   losses at birth which includes all calves died till a certain time after
   birth, insert these data in the vectors for stillborn calves and fill only 
   zeros in the vectors for calves died to 48 hours after birth.

   Some of the probabilities of calving score at the end of the input file may
   be of no concern. For example, if the number of classes for calving 
   performance (specified in INPUT11.TXT) is 4, all values for calving scores 5 
   and 6 are ignored. If there is no crossbreeding in the system, the calving 
   scores for cross-bred animals are not read. Do not omit rows with unnecessary 
   information in the input file. 
   The program will skip the inputs which are not needed. 

   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands the vector of its values for reproduction
	cycles 1 to LL or 1 to LL-1, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
