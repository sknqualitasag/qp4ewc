/* Input parameters for program EWDC (Production System 4)
   and cross-bred (beef x dairy) progeny.
   For changing input data, change the number(s) in the matrices.
   Be careful when changing input parameters. Please notice that
     the description of the given matrix is posted under the matrix.
   The rows represent the commercial classes for fleshiness, the columns the
     classes for fat covering.
   The matrices of coefficients of carcass prices show the ratio of the price
     per kg carcass in the given class to the price in the class which is used
     as the reference class (base class). See Manual for more explanations.
   The price of the base class is an input parameter in the input files
     INPUT11.TXT and INPUT23.TXT. */
