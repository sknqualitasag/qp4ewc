/* This file is necessary for program EWDC if genetic standard deviations 
   of the traits are known and are not differentiated between direct and
   maternal components. It is read only if there is no crossbreeding
   in the herd or if there is terminal crossing.
   It contains input parameters (genetic standard deviations) for calculating 
   the standardized marginal economic values of traits. Keep attention that 
   the genetic standard deviations are given in the correct units.
   The genetic standard deviations must be for the breed the economic values
   are calculated for.
   The appropriate input is skipped if the trait is not considered in the
   calculation.  
   All input data are arranged in the following way 
        each parameter takes three parts,
        the parameter value or vector of values are given in the first row(s), 
        the string expression in the second part describes the parameter and
        the last string in the third part contains the units of the parameter.
        If there is no unit given, [SPACE] is written enclosed into quotation
        marks. */
