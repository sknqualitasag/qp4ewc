/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for intensive fattening (variant 1 
   of fattening) of heifers and castrates in Production Systems 1 to 3. 
   If no castrates are fattened the input parameters referring to castrates
   will be ignored.
   Losses of animals are defined as animals died during the fattening period 
   as proportion of all animals entering fattening. 
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks. 
   MU: monetary unit */
