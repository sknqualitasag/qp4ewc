/* This file is necessary for program EWBC if genetic standard deviations
   of the traits are known for the direct and maternal components of the
   traits.
   It contains input parameters (genetic standard deviations) for calculating
   the relative economic weights of traits. If there are direct and maternal
   components of a trait two input values are to be given, otherwise only one
   value is given. Keep attention that the genetic standard deviations are
   given in correct units.
   The genetic standard deviations must be for the breed the economic weights
   are calculated for.
   The appropriate input is skipped if the trait is not considered in the
   calculation.
   All input data are arranged in the following way
        each parameter takes three parts,
        the parameter value or vector of values are given in the first row(s),
        the string expression in the second part describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third part contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, [SPACE] is written enclosed into quotation
	marks. */
