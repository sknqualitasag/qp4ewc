/* This file is necessary for program EWBC for Production Systems 1 and 2 only.
   It includes input parameters referring to breeding heifers from weaning to
   calving or to selling. Selling of pregnant or not mated heifers is possible.
   If not enough female calves are reared for replacement the input parameters
   referring to purchased breeding heifers (the last two parameters in this
   file) are to be filled in.
   If there is only one feeding season defined for the whole year in 
   INPUT01.TXT, insert only values for feeding season with code 1; 
   the values for feeding season with code 2 are not read.
   
   All input data are arranged in the following way:
	each parameter takes three rows,
	in the first row stands its value, 
	the string expression in the second row describes the parameter and
	the last string in the third row contains the units of the parameter.
	If there is no unit given, enter [SPACE] enclosed into quotation
	marks.
