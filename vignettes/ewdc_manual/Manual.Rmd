# Aim

In this vignette, you will get more information about the construction of the main-functions `pre_process_ew_input()` and `post_process_ewdc_output`. 
The task of `pre_process_ew_input()` is to pre-process the input-parameter-files for ECOWEIGHT specific for dairy cattle (EWDC).
Whereas the task of `post_process_ewdc_output` is to extract from the result file of ECOWEIGHT specific for dairy cattle economic weights and population means for a specific scenario.

# Pre-processing part

Major steps of `pre_process_ew_input()` are 

 1) function `create_directory_scenario()` : create directory per scenario with input-parameter-file for ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function create_directory_scenario().
 
 2) Read file with input from literature research and update input-parameter-file coming from literature of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the part only from literature. Next to the literature some initial parameter need to be set for EWDC (ECOWEIGHT Dairy Cattle). Further depending of the 
 * `s_sirebreed` and `s_dambreed` some values for maturity type of progeny are set, 

 3) function `pre_process_ew_input_calving()` : Pre-processing the calving data for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ew_input_calving().
 
 4) function `pre_process_ewdc_input_progeny_data_flp()` : Pre-processing the progeny data flp for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ewdc_input_progeny_data_flp(). 
 
 5) function `pre_process_ew_input_carcass_data_flp()` : Pre-processing the carcass conformation, fat, prices based on flp-data for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ew_input_carcass_data_flp().

                     ps_input_file_ped = s_input_file_ped,

```

The input-files are now ready to execute ECOWEIGHT for dairy cattle (EWDC). This need to be done separately and is not part of the package qp4ewc.
As soon as we have the result file of ECOWEIGHT for dairy cattle, we can run the post-processing part to extract economic weights and population means.

# Post-processing part

The major step of `post_process_ewdc_output` is to read output file from ECOWEIGHT and makes single table with piechart per scenario. 
More details to this step is in the vignette number 6.

Because numerous scenari can be calculated, in the vignette number 7, you can find an extra function how to sort by sirebreed or dambreed or marketing channel to facilite the interpretation of the results.

## Parameters

To show how `post_process_ewdc_output` is build, we made some test-file from ECOWEIGHT (EWDC).

```{r}
#Path to file
s_path_2outputfile <- system.file("extdata","ewdc","Ecoweight_output",
                                  paste0(s_sirebreed,"_",s_dambreed, "_",s_prodsystew,"_",s_marketingchannel,"_test",collapse = ""),
                                  "test",package = "qp4ewc")
# Path to output statements from the results file of ewdc
s_output_statement <-  system.file("extdata","ewdc","output_statement.txt", package = "qp4ewc")
# Path to search patterns needed to find correct results 
s_output_search_pattern <- system.file("extdata","ewdc","output_searchpattern.txt", package = "qp4ewc")
# Path to genetic standard deviation values 
s_input_genetic_SD <- system.file("extdata","ewdc","input_geneticSD.txt", package = "qp4ewc")
# Scenario
s_scenario <- paste0(s_sirebreed,"_",s_dambreed, "_",s_prodsystew,"_",s_marketingchannel,"_test",collapse = "")
# Path to save table of result 
s_path_extracted_results <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
post_process_ewdc_output(ps_path_2outputfile = s_path_2outputfile,
                         ps_output_statement = s_output_statement,
                         ps_output_search_pattern = s_output_search_pattern,
                         ps_sirebreed = s_sirebreed,
                         ps_dambreed = s_dambreed,
                         ps_prodsystew = s_prodsystew,
                         ps_marketchannel = s_marketingchannel,
                         ps_path_directory2create = s_path_directory2create,
                         ps_scenario = s_scenario,
                         ps_path_tbl_save = s_path_extracted_results,
                         ps_input_genetic_SD = s_input_genetic_SD,
                         pb_log = b_log)
```
