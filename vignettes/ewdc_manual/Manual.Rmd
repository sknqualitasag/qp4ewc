# Aim

In this vignette, you will get more information about the construction of the main-function `pre_process_ew_input()`. The task of this function is to pre-process the input-parameter-files of ECOWEIGHT for dairy cattle (EWDC).

# Parameters

The parameters needed for beef-on-dairy are:


```{r}
# Sire breed can be: AN,AU,CH,LM,OB,SI corresponding to Angus,Aubrac, Charolais, Limousin, Original-Braunvieh, Simmental
s_sirebreed <- "AN"
# Dam breed can be for beef-on-dairy: HO,BS corresponding to Holstein or Brown Swiss (+Braunvieh) 
s_dambreed <- "HO"
# Production system according to ECOWEIGHT for beef-on-dairy: 4 corresponding to dairy
s_prodsystew <- "4"
# Marketing channel can be: ConventionalBeef, ConventionalVeal, Export corresponding to intensive fattening system for beef or veal or all crossbred calves being sold as calves to the handler

s_input_file_36 <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewbc","input36_statement.txt")
# Path to specific input for ProdSyst1 for tested bulls (this is only for beef-on-beef needed)
s_input_file_testedbulls <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewbc","input_testedbulls.txt")

# Path to calving data file
s_input_file_calving <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","test","test_zws_muku_gal.csv")
# Date YYYYMMDD used as start date to filter data for calving or carcass
s_start_date <- 20160101
# Date YYYYMMDD used as end date to filter data for calving or carcass
s_end_date <- 20211231
# Path to input from the progeny flp data. Based on this example an other file can be created with different input-values.
s_input_file_progeny_flp_statement <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","input_flp_statement.txt")
# Path to flp data file
s_input_file_flp <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewbc","test","zws_muku_flp.csv")
# Path to calf price data file
s_input_file_calf <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewbc","test","test_calf_data.csv")
# Path to input statement for carcass and price
s_input_file_flp_carcass_matrix_statement <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","input_flp_carcass_matrix_statement.txt")
# Path to input with cow price. Based on this example an other file can be created with different input-values.
s_input_file_price_cow <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","cow_price.txt")
# Path to input with bull price. Based on this example an other file can be created with different input-values.
s_input_file_price_bull <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","bull_price.txt")
# Path to input with heifer price. Based on this example an other file can be created with different input-values.
s_input_file_price_heifer <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","heifer_price.txt")
# Path to input with heifer price. Based on this example an other file can be created with different input-values.
s_input_file_price_calf <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewdc","veal_price.txt")
# Path to pedigree input file
s_input_file_ped <- file.path(here::here(),"inst","extdata","ewbc","test","test_pedigree.txt")
# Flag to set to TRUE, if a log-file is whished
b_log <- TRUE
```

# Logfile

At the beginning of the function depending of the setting for `pb_log` and `plogger`, a log-file will be created.

# Major steps of pre_process_ew_input() are

 1) function `create_directory_scenario()` : create directory per scenario with input-parameter-file for ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function create_directory_scenario().
 
 2) Read file with input from literature research and update input-parameter-file coming from literature of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the part only from literature. Next to the literature some initial parameter need to be set for EWDC (ECOWEIGHT Dairy Cattle). Further depending of the 
 * `s_sirebreed` and `s_dambreed` some values for maturity type of progeny, 

 3) function `pre_process_ew_input_calving()` : Pre-processing the calving data for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ew_input_calving().
 
 4) function `pre_process_ewdc_input_progeny_data_flp()` : Pre-processing the progeny data flp for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ewdc_input_progeny_data_flp(). 
 
 5) function `pre_process_ew_input_carcass_data_flp()` : Pre-processing the carcass conformation, fat, prices based on flp-data for input-parameter-file of ECOWEIGHT. Details in the vignette Explain the function pre_process_ew_input_carcass_data_flp().

# Run pre_process_ew_input() in RStudio


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pre_process_ew_input(ps_sirebreed = s_sirebreed,
                     ps_dambreed = s_dambreed,
                     ps_prodsystew = s_prodsystew,
                     ps_marketchannel = s_marketingchannel,
                     ps_path_directory2create = s_path_directory2create,
                     ps_input_file_literature = s_input_file_literature,
                     ps_input_file_par = s_input_file_par,
                     ps_input_file_35 = s_input_file_35,
                     ps_input_file_36 = s_input_file_36,
                     ps_input_file_testedbulls = s_input_file_testedbulls,
                     ps_input_file_purchasedreplacementheifers = s_input_file_purchasedreplacementheifers,
                     ps_input_file_calving_statement = s_input_file_calving_statement,
                     ps_input_file_calving = s_input_file_calving,
                     ps_start_date = s_start_date,
                     ps_end_date = s_end_date,
                     ps_input_file_progeny_flp_statement = s_input_file_progeny_flp_statement,
                     ps_input_file_flp = s_input_file_flp,
                     ps_input_file_calf = s_input_file_calf,
                     ps_input_file_flp_carcass_matrix_statement = s_input_file_flp_carcass_matrix_statement,
                     ps_input_file_price_cow = s_input_file_price_cow,
                     ps_input_file_price_bull = s_input_file_price_bull,
                     ps_input_file_price_heifer = s_input_file_price_heifer,
                     ps_input_file_price_calf = s_input_file_price_calf,
                     ps_input_file_ped = s_input_file_ped,
                     pb_log = b_log)
```

```{r}
#Path to files
path_results_files <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "Ecoweight_output")
# Path to output statements from the results file of ewdc
s_output_statement <-  file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "output_statement.txt")
# Path to search patterns needed to find correct results 
s_output_search_pattern <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "output_searchpattern.txt")
# Path to save table of result 
s_path_tbl_save <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")
# Name of results file from ewdc
s_results_name <- "test"
# Flag to set to TRUE, if a log-file is whished
b_log <- TRUE
```

Step 1 post processing reads data from the results files and makes single tables per scenario.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
results_files <- data.frame(filename = list.files(paste0(path_results_files,"/")))

for(idx in 1:nrow(results_files)){
  s_path_2outputfile <- paste0(path_results_files,"/",results_files[idx,],"/",s_results_name)
  s_scenario <- results_files[idx,]
post_process_ewdc_output(ps_path_2outputfile = s_path_2outputfile,
                         ps_output_statement = s_output_statement,
                         ps_output_search_pattern = s_output_search_pattern,
                         ps_path_tbl_save = s_path_tbl_save,
                         ps_scenario = s_scenario,
                         pb_log = b_log)
}
```

Step 2 post processing combines the single scenario tables into tables sorted by the defined criteria for s_sort_by

sort by sire: 
```{r}
# How you want the tables to be organised. one table per sire breed (sire_breed), one table per dam breed (dam_breed) or one table per marketing channel (marketing_channel)
s_sort_by = "sire_breed"
# Path to the results tables printed from the post_processing_ewdc_output function above
s_path_results_tbl <-  file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")
# Where to save the tables of results: this can be the same or different to the directory for the results saved from the initial post processing 
s_path_save <-   file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")

create_table_results_ewdc(ps_sort_by = s_sort_by,
 ps_path_results_tbl = s_path_results_tbl,
 ps_path_save = s_path_save,
pb_log = b_log)

```

sort by dam:
```{r}
s_sort_by = "dam_breed"
s_path_results_tbl <-  file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")
s_path_save <-  file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")

create_table_results_ewdc(ps_sort_by = s_sort_by,
 ps_path_results_tbl = s_path_results_tbl,
 ps_path_save = s_path_save,
pb_log = b_log)

```

sort by marketing channel 
```{r}
s_sort_by = "marketing_channel"
s_path_results_tbl <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")
s_path_save <- file.path(here::here(),"inst", "extdata", "ewdc", "results")

create_table_results_ewdc(ps_sort_by = s_sort_by,
 ps_path_results_tbl = s_path_results_tbl,
 ps_path_save = s_path_save,
pb_log = b_log)

```
